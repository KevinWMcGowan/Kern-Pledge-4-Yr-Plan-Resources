**“Commerical for profit” Colleges and Career Training Programs**

There are many good commercial colleges and programs, and they can often be the best choice for some students in certain situations. For-profit institutions offer career training programs that are also available at non-profit public career training programs (ROC) and two-year community colleges (Bakersfield, Cerro Coso or Taft colleges). Keep in mind that it is important to “do your homework” and compare prices and programs available at the Regional Occupational Center, Bakersfield Adult School, and Bakersfield College before signing any contracts for profit schools.
Many for-profit schools will promise job placement after completing the program. This doesn’t always happen because you must still interview and be hired depending on your own abilities, education, and attributes. Students who do not interview as well may end up with the training but no job to show for the money invested in the program. Often, the units you earn at these schools will not transfer to other colleges and universities causing you to have to “start over” if you leave the program and change schools.

According to a study conducted by the Education Trust, the combination of lower success rates and higher prices can potentially have a huge impact on your future financial stability. Students in for-profit institutions may finish with more debt, according to the study. The average debt of graduates of for-profit schools can add up to $31,190 - nearly twice that of non-profit private colleges and university graduates.
There are many good commercial colleges located in Bakersfield. Many on-line schools are also now available. Remember, buyer beware! Before you sign a contract, compare prices and programs with your local community college and ROC program to make an informed choice. There may be less expensive options out there for the same type of training.

**Out-of-State Colleges**

There are numerous out-of-state public and private colleges and universities. However, you will be required to pay out-of-state tuition which will increase your overall tuition costs. Consult the individual college websites for more information.
